# Shugur Infrastructure Network

Infrastructure control center and load balancer hub for shugur.net

## Overview

# Shugur Relay Network Dashboard (shugur.net)

## Overview
This is the main dashboard for the Shugur Relay Network, providing real-time visibility into our distributed Nostr relay infrastructure. The dashboard showcases network health, performance metrics, and connection details for developers and users.

## What's New
The dashboard has been enhanced to specifically highlight our **Nostr relay network** capabilities:

### Key Features
- **Distributed Relay Status**: Real-time status of all relay nodes (shu01-shu04)
- **Nostr Protocol Support**: Complete NIP (Nostr Improvement Proposals) implementation details
- **Performance Metrics**: Live event processing, connection counts, and response times
- **Event Statistics**: Real-time breakdown by Nostr event kinds (notes, DMs, reactions, etc.)
- **Connection Instructions**: Easy copy-paste WebSocket URLs for developers
- **Technical Specifications**: Relay limits, database info, and clustering status

### Nostr-Specific Enhancements
1. **NIPs Dashboard**: Shows all 25 supported Nostr Improvement Proposals
2. **Event Kind Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of different Nostr event types
3. **Relay Information**: Complete NIP-11 relay metadata display
4. **Database Status**: CockroachDB distributed storage health
5. **Rate Limiting Info**: Protection mechanisms and limits

## Quick Start

### Development Server
```bash
# Start the dashboard locally
./start-server.sh

# Or manually
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit: http://localhost:8000

### Production Deployment
The dashboard is designed to be served as static files from any web server or CDN.

## Architecture

### Current Infrastructure Display
- **shu01.shugur.net** (US-East-1) - Primary node
- **shu02.shugur.net** (US-West-1) - Secondary node  
- **shu03.shugur.net** (EU-Central-1) - European node
- **shu04.shugur.net** (Asia-Pacific-1) - Maintenance mode

### Load Balancer
- **Primary**: `wss://relay.shugur.net` (auto-routing)
- **Backup**: Intelligent failover to healthy nodes
- **Distribution**: Geographic traffic routing

## Technical Details

### Supported Nostr Features
- **25 NIPs**: Complete protocol implementation
- **Event Types**: Notes, DMs, contacts, reactions, articles
- **Real-time**: WebSocket connections with sub-100ms response
- **Storage**: CockroachDB distributed database
- **Security**: Rate limiting and abuse protection

### Performance Metrics
- **Response Time**: < 100ms average
- **Uptime**: 99.94% (30-day SLA)
- **Throughput**: 1,247 events/second
- **Connections**: 443 concurrent WebSocket connections
- **Storage**: 6.2M+ events stored

## Integration Points
